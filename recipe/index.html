            <h3>Shortbread History</h3>
            <p><strong>Shortbread</strong> was created by accident somewhere in the 12th century when leftover bread dough was left out to dry and become a "<em>biscuit</em>." The butter replaced the yeast and the "<em>biscuit</em>" evolved into <b>Shortbread</b>, the term short came from the texture that butter gave it. This was only for special occasions and for the rich as butter was a luxery. The more refined version of <b>Shortbread</b> is attributed to Scotland as it was popular there.</p>
